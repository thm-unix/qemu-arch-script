# qemu-arch-script
This script created to quickly install Arch Linux
on my QEMU virtual machine for testing software. 
Do not use it for real installations. Please visit 
https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/installation_guide
for Installation guide. I created this script for
convenient installation on my VM.<br><br>
